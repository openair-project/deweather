reference:
- title: Data
  desc: >
    Example datasets included with the package, used to demonstrate and test
    deweathering functions.
  contents: aqroadside

- title: Tune
  desc: >
    Tune hyperparameters for a deweathering model before it is fit. A 'best' 
    parameter set is automatically determined, but other functions are provided 
    to allow for closer interrogation so that these can be refined.
  contents:
  - tune_dw_model
  - plot_tdw_metrics 
  - plot_tdw_scatter
    
- title: Build
  desc: >
    Core functions for fitting deweathering models, used throughout the rest 
    of the `deweather` package for interpretation and prediction.
  contents:
  - build_dw_model
  - finalise_tdw_model
  - append_dw_vars

- title: Examine
  desc: >
    'getters' to extract specific features of a built `deweather` model or a 
    `deweather` 'tuning' object.
  contents:
  - get_dw_pollutant
  - get_tdw_pollutant

- title: Visualise
  desc: >
    Functions for visualizing model components and relationships, including
    variable importance and partial dependence plots.
  contents:
  - plot_dw_importance
  - plot_dw_partial_1d
  - plot_dw_partial_2d

- title: Predict
  desc: >
    Functions to apply a deweathering model for prediction.
  contents:
  - predict_dw
  - simulate_dw_met
